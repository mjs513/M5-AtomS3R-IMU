# M5-AtomS3R-IMU

AHRS Algorithm:
Current set up to use the Madgwick Fusion algorithm: https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Fusion

Calibration:
Magnetometer calibration is done using the PJRC MotionCal: https://www.pjrc.com/store/prop_shield.html.  Interface sketch provided
Accelerometer calibration is done using a 6 point calibration routine - sketch provided.

See https://github.com/mjs513/IMU-Calibration-Methods for more info on calibration.
